# Enhanced Logging System - Complete Timestamp Coverage

## Overview

I've implemented a comprehensive logging system that provides detailed timestamps for ALL operations in your evc2bank application. Here's what's been enhanced:

## üÜï New Enhanced Logger Features

### 1. **Enhanced Logger Utility** (`utils/enhancedLogger.js`)
- **Timestamps**: Every log entry includes ISO 8601 timestamps with milliseconds
- **Color-coded Console Output**: Different colors for different log levels
- **File Logging**: Automatic log files with date-based naming
- **Performance Timing**: Built-in timer functions for measuring operation duration
- **Categorized Logging**: Specific categories (AUTH, DATABASE, TRANSACTION, WALLET, etc.)

### 2. **Request/Response Middleware** (`middleware/logger.js`)
- **Request Logging**: Full request details with timestamps
- **Response Logging**: Response status, duration, and data
- **Performance Metrics**: Automatic timing of all HTTP requests

### 3. **Server Startup Logging** (`server.js`)
- **Startup Sequence**: Detailed timestamps for each startup phase
- **Database Connection**: Connection timing and status
- **Route Registration**: Available endpoints logged at startup

### 4. **Database Connection Logging** (`utils/mongodb.js`)
- **Connection Attempts**: Detailed connection process logging
- **Connection Events**: Automatic logging of MongoDB events
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error logging with context

## üìä Controller-Level Logging

### Authentication Controller (`controllers/authcontroller.js`)
```javascript
// Every registration/login now includes:
- User registration/login attempts with timestamps
- Password hashing operations timing
- Database operations tracking
- Token generation logging
- Success/failure with detailed context
```

### User Controller (`controllers/userController.js`)
```javascript
// All user operations now log:
- User creation with wallet initialization timing
- User retrieval operations
- Update operations with admin checks
- Deletion operations with authorization tracking
```

### Wallet Controller (`controllers/walletController.js`)
```javascript
// Wallet operations logging:
- Wallet retrieval with access control checks
- Balance updates with before/after values
- Wallet creation and deletion operations
- Admin permission validations
```

### Transaction Controller (`controllers/transactionController.js`)
```javascript
// Transaction logging includes:
- Transfer initiation timestamps
- Balance validation checks
- Transfer processing steps
- Transaction record creation
- Success/failure with detailed metrics
```

## üîç Log Output Examples

### Console Output (Color-coded)
```
[2025-01-09T10:30:45.123Z] [INFO] [SERVER] Initializing server startup...
[2025-01-09T10:30:45.125Z] [INFO] [DATABASE] Attempting database connection...
[2025-01-09T10:30:45.234Z] [SUCCESS] [DATABASE] MongoDB connected successfully
[2025-01-09T10:30:45.235Z] [INFO] [REQUEST] Incoming POST request to /api/auth/login
[2025-01-09T10:30:45.236Z] [INFO] [AUTH] User login attempt
[2025-01-09T10:30:45.245Z] [SUCCESS] [AUTH_SUCCESS] User logged in successfully
[2025-01-09T10:30:45.246Z] [SUCCESS] [RESPONSE] Response sent with status 200
```

### File Logs (`logs/combined-YYYY-MM-DD.log`)
```json
{"timestamp":"2025-01-09T10:30:45.123Z","level":"INFO","category":"SERVER","message":"Initializing server startup..."}
{"timestamp":"2025-01-09T10:30:45.125Z","level":"INFO","category":"DATABASE","message":"Attempting database connection...","data":{"url":"//***:***@cluster"}}
{"timestamp":"2025-01-09T10:30:45.234Z","level":"SUCCESS","category":"DATABASE","message":"MongoDB connected successfully","data":{"host":"cluster.mongodb.net","port":27017,"database":"evc2bank"}}
```

## üìÅ Log Files Structure

```
logs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ combined-2025-01-09.log    # All logs combined
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ error-2025-01-09.log       # Error logs only
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ combined-2025-01-10.log    # Next day's logs
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ error-2025-01-10.log       # Next day's errors
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è Performance Metrics

Every operation now includes timing information:
- **Database Operations**: Connection times, query execution times
- **Authentication**: Login/registration duration
- **Transactions**: Transfer processing time
- **HTTP Requests**: Full request-response cycle timing

## üîí Security Features

- **Password Protection**: Passwords never logged in plain text
- **Credential Masking**: Database URLs mask credentials in logs
- **Access Control**: Unauthorized access attempts are logged
- **Error Context**: Full error context without sensitive data

## üéØ Log Categories

- **SERVER**: Server startup, shutdown, configuration
- **DATABASE**: MongoDB operations, connections, queries
- **AUTH**: Authentication and authorization operations
- **USER**: User management operations
- **WALLET**: Wallet operations and balance changes
- **TRANSACTION**: Money transfers and transaction processing
- **REQUEST**: HTTP request details
- **RESPONSE**: HTTP response details and timing
- **PERFORMANCE**: Operation timing and performance metrics

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Start the server**: All startup operations will be logged with timestamps
2. **Make API calls**: Every request/response is automatically logged
3. **Check logs**: 
   - Real-time: Watch console output with color coding
   - Historical: Check `logs/` directory for detailed JSON logs
4. **Monitor performance**: Built-in timing for all operations

## üìà Benefits

‚úÖ **Complete Visibility**: Every operation has a timestamp  
‚úÖ **Performance Monitoring**: Timing data for optimization  
‚úÖ **Debugging**: Detailed error context and stack traces  
‚úÖ **Security Auditing**: All access attempts logged  
‚úÖ **Compliance**: Comprehensive audit trail  
‚úÖ **Maintenance**: Easy troubleshooting with detailed logs  

The enhanced logging system now provides complete timestamp coverage for all operations in your evc2bank application!
